// The migration chain.
//
// ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A RELEASED MIGRATION IS NEVER EDITED. NOT ONCE. NOT TO FIX IT.
//
// A migration that gets "corrected" after release produces two different worlds from the
// same file depending on which deploy the player happened to load — and the two worlds are
// both plausible, so nothing catches it. If a released migration is wrong, the repair is a
// NEW step on the end of the chain that undoes the damage. Never a change to the old one.
//
// ONE REAL SAVE FIXTURE IS KEPT PER RELEASED FORMAT VERSION, FOREVER. A hand-written
// fixture tests the migration you imagined; a real save tests the one you shipped. They are
// small, they never change, and they are the only thing that will catch a migration bug in
// 2029. See `test/fixtures/saves/`.
// ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// For v0.1 the chain has length zero: `CURRENT_FORMAT_VERSION` is 1 and there is nothing to
// migrate. The mechanism is built anyway, because it costs an hour now and a rewrite later
// — and because plan §12 names the first save format a real world uses as one of the four
// one-way doors. Once Lucas plays a world he cares about, every future build either reads
// that file or throws it away. There is no third option.
